## Introduction

Cypress is a powerful end-to-end testing framework that helps you ensure the quality of your web applications. This project provides a recommended folder structure and best practices to help you maintain clean, maintainable, and efficient test code.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into four main directories:

### Fixtures

The `fixtures` directory contains test data files that your tests can use. Keeping your test data separate from your test code helps maintain readability and makes it easier to update data without modifying test scripts.

### Integration

The `integration` directory houses your test files. These files contain the actual test scripts that interact with your application. Organize your tests logically and consider using subdirectories to group related tests.

### Report

The `report` directory is where test result files and reports are stored. This can include screenshots, videos, and any generated reports to analyze test results.

### Support

The `support` directory is meant for utility functions, custom commands, and page objects. This separation keeps your test scripts clean and readable, as well as facilitates code reuse across different test cases.

## Fixtures

The `fixtures` directory is used to store static test data that your tests can use. These files could contain JSON, XML, or any other format that your application uses for data. Placing them in this directory keeps your test code separate from the test data, making it easier to maintain and update.

## Integration

The `integration` directory holds your test scripts. Organize your tests in a way that makes sense for your application. You might group tests by feature, module, or any other logical division. Clear organization helps you easily locate and manage your test cases.

## Report

The `report` directory is where you store various test result files and reports. This could include screenshots or videos of test runs, as well as any generated HTML or PDF reports summarizing test outcomes.

## Support

The `support` directory contains utility functions, custom commands, and page objects that your test scripts depend on. Separating these from your test cases keeps your tests focused on the actual testing logic and promotes code reusability.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/cypress-best-practices.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd cypress-best-practices`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Write your Cypress tests in the `integration` directory.
5. Use the `fixtures` and `support` directories to manage your test data and utility functions.
6. Run tests: `npm run test`
